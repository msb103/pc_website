<p> The golden goose story is one of the very famous fables. The story is based around a magical goose that lays golden eggs. 
  As with most kids' stories, the golden goose story also conveys a valuable moral that can be learned as we read the story. 
  Here is a simplified version of the golden goose story that is suitable for kids. </p>

  <p>Once upon a time, there used to be a farmer and his wife who dwelt in a town. The farmer and his family were very poor. 
    The farmer used to grow vegetables. He would then go to the town to sell those vegetables and earn a living. 
    One day the farmer decided to save some money, slowly as the day went by, the farmer saved a small sum of money. 
    With the money that he saved he bought a goose. The farmer and his wife hoped that the goose will lay eggs that they can use for 
    breakfast and can also sell in the town. He took the goose home and built it a nest in which it could lay eggs. 
    When he went to check for eggs the next morning, he lifted the goose, and to his surprise, the goose had laid a golden egg. 
    The farmer informed his wife, they were surprised by the golden egg. They woke up the next day to find another golden egg laid by the goose.</p>

  <p>The farmer decided to sell the golden eggs laid by the goose. Happy with the golden eggs, the farmer slowly became wealthy. 
    One day, the farmerâ€™s wife said that the golden goose lays only one egg a day, what if there could be a way to collect all the eggs at once.
     This would mean that they can become richer quickly. The farmer agreed to this, they both decided to cut open the goose to collect all the 
     eggs at once.

    They cut the goose but to their surprise, there were no golden eggs inside the goose. The farmer and his wife cried as they realized that 
    they killed the golden goose and now there would not be any golden eggs. They became poor again and regretted their actions.</p>

    <p style="color: rgb(2, 2, 39); font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase">If every successful product is synonymous to the golden egg in our story, what would the golden goose look like?</p>
