          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <h4> At Product Crafts, we bring to life new technology and products that have the ability to induce positive 
           business disruption in the world. We do this by forging sound engineering fundamentals and design principles with astute 
           craftsmanship that enable us in creating beautiful products. 
            <br>
            <br>

            There are innumerable hidden gems in the world of engineering and design, that are hiding in plain sight. 
            These specialities when combined with certain aspects of cutting edge research when needed, give rise to amazing creations.
            We aim to unearth these hidden gems in a systematical way and create a new world of innovations that give us a forward posture
            in driving the future. 
            <br>
            <br>

            We are driven by 5 principle values that guide us in crafting products. <br>
            1 . Drive positive business disruption <br>
            2. Inclusion of Engineering (Math) and Design (Art)<br>
            3. Designs that are sustainable and blend with nature<br>
            4. Bring cutting edge research into public consumption<br>
            5. Have fun while doing all the above<br>

            <br>

            At Product Crafts, we focus on bridging the gap between research and production by creating designs that are ready to manufacture 
            on Day 1. We cover your engineering, design and financial risk of designing new products and solutions while you stay focused on introducing 
            them to the world.
