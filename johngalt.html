<p class="para"> John Galt is the protagonist of the Novel "Atlas Shrugged" written by Ayn Rand. Galt is a philosopher and inventor. 
  He believes in the power and glory of the human mind, and the rights of individuals to use their minds solely for themselves. 
  He serves as a highly individualistic counterpoint to the collectivist social and economic structure depicted in the novel, 
  in which society is based on oppressive bureaucratic functionaries and a culture that embraces mediocrity in the name of 
  social egalitarianism, which the novel posits is the result of collectivist philosophy. </p>

  <p class="para"> The novel unfolds Galt's story in a progressive retrospective, with Galt, the son of an Ohio garage mechanic, 
  leaving home at age twelve and beginning college at the fictional Patrick Henry University at age sixteen. 
  There he meets Francisco d'Anconia and Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld, who become his two closest friends. 
  Galt takes a double major in physics and philosophy, and after graduating, he becomes an engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company, 
  where he designs a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity. When the company owner dies and his heirs decide to 
  run the factory by the collectivist maxim, "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need", Galt refuses to work 
  there any longer and abandons his motor.</p>
  
  <p class="para"> During the main storyline of the book, Galt works from the shadows and secretly influences the world's creative leaders 
    including inventors, artists and businessmen, in an effort to save the best to rebuild a new world away from the collectivist maxim.  
    An intellect who invented a revolutionary motor, a visionary and a leader who assembles the best to
    create a new world, Galt is the face of disruption of the world order.</p>
