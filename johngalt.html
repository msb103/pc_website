<p> John Galt is a character in the Novel "Atlas Shrugged" written by Ayn Rand. Galt is a philosopher and inventor; 
  he believes in the power and glory of the human mind, and the rights of individuals to use their minds solely for themselves. 
  He serves as a highly individualistic counterpoint to the collectivist social and economic structure depicted in the novel, 
  in which society is based on oppressive bureaucratic functionaries and a culture that embraces mediocrity in the name of 
  social egalitarianism, which the novel posits is the result of collectivist philosophy. </p>

  <p>The novel unfolds Galt's story in a progressive retrospective, with Galt, the son of an Ohio garage mechanic, 
  leaving home at age twelve and beginning college at the fictional Patrick Henry University at age sixteen. 
  There he meets Francisco d'Anconia and Ragnar Danneskj√∂ld, who become his two closest friends. 
  Galt takes a double major in physics and philosophy, and after graduating, he becomes an engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company, 
  where he designs a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity. When the company owner dies and his heirs decide to 
  run the factory by the collectivist maxim, "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need", Galt refuses to work 
  there any longer and abandons his motor.</p>

  <p>During the main storyline of the book, Galt has secretly organized a strike by the world's creative leaders, including inventors, 
    artists and businessmen, in an effort to "stop the motor of the world" and bring about the collapse of the bureaucratic society. 
    While working incognito as a laborer for Taggart Transcontinental railroad, he travels to visit the key figures that he has not yet 
    recruited, systematically persuading them to join the strike. This strike is not revealed immediately within the story, but forms the 
    backdrop of the novel as a mystery which protagonist Dagny Taggart seeks to uncover, with Galt as her antagonist. She calls him 
    "The Destroyer" and regards him as her arch-enemy, on one occasion seeing a door which just closed and realizing he had been in the 
    room ahead of her. The strikers have created their own secret enclave known as "Galt's Gulch", a town secluded in a Colorado mountain 
    valley, based on Ouray, Colorado.</p>
