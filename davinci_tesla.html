<p style= "font-weight:bold"> Did Leonardo DaVinci really meet Nikola Tesla ?</p>
<p>No, but wouldn't you be more curious to know what they would have discussed if they met. Leonardo DaVinci and Nikola Tesla are from two different 
  time periods   and there is no chance they would have met. But the more curious intellectually profound question would be - What if they 
  were to be born in the same time period? What if they met? What would they have discussed?</p>

  <p style= "font-weight:bold"> Who is Leonardo DaVinci ?</p>
  <p> Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a 
    painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.[3] While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a 
    painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, 
    astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal,[4] and his collective 
    works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo</p>

    <p style= "font-weight:bold"> Who is Nikola Tesla ?</p>
    <p>Nikola Tesla (10 July  1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist. 
      He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system</p>

  <p> Both DaVinci's and Tesla's notes and books have been widely studied, researched and revered by various enthusiasts over time. 
    Their work continues to astound generations after generations of Math, Design, Art and Engineering students alike till date. Can you imagine 
    what would these two great polymaths of this century discuss, work on and create together if we gave them the resources that we have today?
